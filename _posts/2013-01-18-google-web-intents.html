	<p><strong>Note: these were only built as demos</strong> — we worked with a Google Dev to show these off during the 2012 Google i/o conference. They only were made to work in Chrome Canary or Chrome Developer, so they may crash your browser when trying to use the Web Intents.</p>

	<h3>What I Did</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>worked with a Google developer to re-design four apps he built for Google i/o conference</li>
		<li>four unique looks that focused solely on what he wanted users to do</li>
		<li>used simple design elements to help drive users to interact with apps</li>
		<li>used K.I.S.S. principle thru and thru</li>
	</ul>
