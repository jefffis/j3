<h2 data-icon="âš’">design + front-end + ruby on rails + heroku</h2>

**Contentboard is a little app that allows non-web savvy folk to uber simply layout some content and adjust some styling.** I built this because I've run into many issues where clients have handed over content, after the design phase completes, and then when they see the content on staging or live, do not like how it flows. Plus, I've also found that being able to view the content in a semi-live state helps the author to massage it and iterate it to a better place.
