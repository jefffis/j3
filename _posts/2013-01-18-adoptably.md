<h2 data-icon="⚒">wireframing + design + front-end + API Integration</h2>
<p><strong>Thousands upon thousands of pets that have no home.</strong> Adoptably aims to make it easy and simple to find a new pet; for you or someone you know who’s looking for one. Just enter your zipcode, choose a type of pet (this is optional), and search!</p>

###What I Did

- designed / built this simple PHP webapp to search Petfinder.com's API for pets available for adoption
- built custom social sharing/email functions to speed pages up
- designed with use on multiple devices in mind; aka RWD
