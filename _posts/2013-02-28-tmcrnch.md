<h2 data-icon="⚒">design + front-end + sendgrid API integration</h2>

I've often been stuck on the metro and wanted to send a super short, simple email to a few peeps letting them know I was stuck there, but without having to log into an app due to limited internet connection.

So I'm testing using **localStorate to save up four email addresses (yours included) to remove the need for account creation** and then letting users choose one of three basic messages to fire off.

**Lemme know what y'all think pls.**
