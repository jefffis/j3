<h2 data-icon="⚒">logo + design + front-end + wordpress</h2>

<p>Sympaq is a leader in cost accounting software, but there website was stuck in the DOS age (witty, I know, but true). So they needed help <strong>visualizing what they offered</strong> as well as having an easier way to publish their knowledge. WordPress was the perfect solution for them, with a wee-bit of customization. We also helped with screencasting using screenr.com and simple voiceovers.</p>

###What I Did

- re-designed site to **increase content accessibility** (which was strong, just not accessible), both on site & off (for maximum seo-impact)
- **simplified the navigation structure**, re-organized the information architecture
- added in **stronger CTAs on all pages**
- storyboarded / created How-To videos using Screenr.com
