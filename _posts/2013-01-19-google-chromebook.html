	<h2 data-icon="⚒">front-end build</h2>
	<p>We worked with Google to build and skin their interface for their new line of Chromebooks. Fortunately we only had to worry about the latest build of Chrome.</p>

	<h3>What I Did</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>took <strong>flat designs and added subtle details to improve</strong> the UX (aka to delight users)</li>
		<li>back &amp; forth with designer to agree on / create <strong>workable solutions to their need for long-winded forms</strong></li>
		<li>added in JS/CSS enhancements to fade in/out page loads for <strong>more app-like feel</strong></li>
	</ul>
