<h2 data-icon="âš’">design + front-end + payment integration</h2>

**Still in progress** Giveab.it is a test project that I'm working on trying to **build a simple way to donate money to charities** (and thusly people) that need it. In our busy world we often forget that us in the tech industry have it pretty sweet, so I want to make something that's also sweet but can do a lot of good for others.
