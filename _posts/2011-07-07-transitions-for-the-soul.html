title: Transitions For The Soul
categories: [thought]
---

<p>The times they are a-changin&rsquo;. In many more ways than one, but that&rsquo;s definitely the understatement of the year. Web technologies change seemingly every few minutes, users expectations of said technologies change as well, some faster than others though. It&rsquo;s a different world when we go to bed than it was when we awoke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite normal for me to feel overwhelmed from time to time. I mean, how can I be relevant to a company or a client when I don&rsquo;t know what just happened on the web just now? I certainly feel like this is a hard question to answer at times. Other times, however, I feel it&rsquo;s not such a hard question to answer. Most companies and clients <strong>dont&rsquo;t even come close to using said cutting edge technology or advances, at least not for a decent amount of time that is</strong>.</p>
<h2>So What&rsquo;s This About</h2>
<p>As things change, so do people. I&rsquo;m ending my time at my current job soon, and with it my half-in / half-out role. For many years, I&rsquo;ve been a jack of all trades, with a background in art, and a lifelong interest in design, and recent enjoyment of code. But, with my new positon, comes a new title and a new role: <code>CSS Developer</code> and <code>full fledged nerdom</code>. I&rsquo;ve always been hesitant to take this sort of plunge, and while not a complete change, say if I were to follow my love of LPs (which I can&rsquo;t figure out how to monetize), I felt this was a great opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>The company I&rsquo;m joining is a web-only company, something <strong>I&rsquo;ve wanted to be part of for a long time</strong>. They are also a RubyonRails (RoR) shop, which I&rsquo;m really jazzed about as well, plus I do love working with code; so it was the right time for me. Eventually, I&rsquo;d love to run my own shop, but until I have more experience with a framework like RoR and just how a web company works, I&rsquo;d rather tag along for the ride.</p>
<h2>What About the Pretty Pictures</h2>
<p>Leaving the design behind is probably going to be quite the transition for me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always wanted, and will always want, to have a <em>[large]</em> hand in how something looks. But for now, I&rsquo;ll keep myself <a href="http://cl.ly/8HEX/o">busy with neat side projects</a>  and living vicariously through twitter and dribbble. My goal is to be back into the design realm in a few years, but with a much richer development background as well.</p>
<p><em>Wish me luck.</em></p>
