title: Social Is A Farce And I Know Nothing
categories: [thought]
---

Social this. Social that. **Bugger it**. It's not really social, is it. We're making digital connections, and for the most part we're not following up with them in 'real life'. Of course some people do, and some people use services like Foursquare to take this to the next step. And then there are conferences/meetups/etc., where you have a better chance of catching up with people you would otherwise only interact with socially...right?

**Social is defined as:** _living or disposed to live in companionship with others or in a community, rather than in isolation_

##The Farse
** where was I going with this
Bam, that's what social is. And social networks are not. But, I had a [recent runin with @medium via twitter](https://twitter.com/jefffis/status/302503462430720001) and it kind of skewed my thoughts on this.
I dunno **

##Email Is Not Dead (I know, beating a dead horse)
I received the first (as I know it) semi-marketing email from @medium on Friday; it was a round-up of posts they deemed appropriate (perhaps there an alogorythm that defines these posts for each user, but that's an aside). I liked it for the most part, but I, being a email marketing/design/dev lover, noticed a few areas where they might want to update their templates to give a better experience to more users. So, via Twitter, we went back and forth and I shared some _helpful_ tips, and even [got CampaignMonitor involved](https://twitter.com/CampaignMonitor/status/302560845479673856). **Long story short,** it was just a refreshing take on social in that, even though I most likely won't meet anyone from either of these companies in person, it was nice to have a cool dialogue with people in San Francisco and Syndey like it was no big deal.

##I Know Nothing
On another aside, I went to a Ruby **un**Conference this weekend and learned that I know nothing, for the most part. It was a cool/interesting format, in that there are no planned sessions, only those suggested when the conference starts and then voted on by the attendees. It's meant to foster more discussion and interaction, and I think for the most part, it did that. However, for designers trying to developers _(such as myself)_, I couldn't contribute much to the chatter. I did get some cool tips/concepts out of the conference though; and there were a few noob sessions that were neato.

- Rails 4 will have [built-in support for Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks), which will be kickass
- tagging tests in rspec can help iteration and identify problem areas without having to run the full gamut of tests on an app
- and lastly SNL's skit Nick Burns is still applicable in todays society

It also included a **Lightning Talks session where people could talk about anything they wanted for 5 minute**. Most were concerned with Ruby or Rails in some capacity, and the 5 minute length made it really interesting; some you wanted more of, and some were just enough -- I would definitely recommend this format for other conferences and meetups.

##A Ray of Hope
But, on sweeter note; seeing/hearing all the cool things that are possible and that other people have worked on, it re-invigorated me. It also showed me that I'm not that far off from being dangerous with Ruby and Rails; and by that, I do mean that in both a good and bad way. **Railsaway!**
