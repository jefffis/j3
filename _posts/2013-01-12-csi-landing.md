<h2 data-icon="⚒">design + front-end + wordpress</h2>

Contact Solutions needed a simple landing page that also engaged users in what their business does. A simple form, a video and visual aids to move the user down the page.

###What I Did

- iterated design comps from their main site to create a **conversion-focused landing page template**
- added strong **visual hierarchy**, a **simple flow**, and a **simple form / strong CTA** to drive conversions
- designed & built the numbered section to help **users easily visualize benefits**
- designed **vertical flow elements to drive users** down but add in multiple CTAs

As an aside, designed and implemented in 2011, this was one of the first sites I know of to **use Proxima Nova**.
