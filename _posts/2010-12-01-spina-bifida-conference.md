<h2 data-icon="⚒">wireframing + design + front-end</h2>

<p>Every year the Spina Bifida Association throws a wonderful conference for families affected by the disease. We helped re-design this site to better drive awareness and engagement, and to help with their ongoing branding efforts. </p>

###What I Did

- re-designed their annual conference website based off their new brand guides & marketing material
- added subtle (& not-so-) details to help **drive registrations and deeper engagement**
- focus on **registration as well as donations** & return engagement
