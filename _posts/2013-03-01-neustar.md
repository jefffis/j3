	<h2 data-icon="âš’">IA + card sort / user-testing + front-end build + responsive iteration</h2>
	<p>Have an image you want to use in a document, or on a website? But is it too big? Before you needed some sort of image editing software <strong>and you needed to know what to do with it</strong>. Not no more! Just upload, choose a max height or width and blammo.</p>
	<p><strong>Now supports CMYK to RGB conversion.</strong> Or, I should, all images are converted to RGB for web support.</p>
	<h3>What I Did</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>designed and built app to <strong>help our/any clients resize images easily</strong></li>
		<li>I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of clients don&#8217;t have access to photo editing software, so this is a simple stop-gap</li>
		<li>uses simple, user focused design to guide users thru the process&#8211;<strong>basically just 2 steps; load an image, choose a max size and voila</strong></li>
	</ul>
