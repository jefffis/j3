<h2 data-icon="⚒">design + ruby on rails + front-end</h2>

Have an image you want to use in a document, or on a website? But is it too big? Before you needed some sort of image editing software **and you needed to know what to do with it**. Not no more! Just upload, choose a max height or width and blammo.

**Now supports CMYK to RGB conversion.** Or, I should, all images are converted to RGB for web support.

###What I Did

- designed and built app to **help our/any clients resize images easily**
- I've noticed a lot of clients don't have access to photo editing software, so this is a simple stop-gap
- uses simple, user focused design to guide users thru the process--**basically just 2  steps; load an image, choose a max size and voila**
