This is something I don't do often enough for sure. Some of this is **laziness, but some of it is just budget constraint**. But this is one of the most important parts of creating success; whether you're building a new product or working on a client project.

##Where to start?
To me, I have recently started first with the basics of the product/project. I did not always do this, and as a visual designer first, this is **very hard to do**, or to at least force yourself to do. Before doing anything visual, [begin to] define what the hell this thing you're working on is. Whether it be a simple template (or set of templates) for a client, or if it's an actual shippable product, **what is necessary and what is extra**.

Once we begin to narrow down the necessry items, this allows us to think about the project as a whole from the onset. And once we add in visual elements, *hopefully* starting this way forces us to question why we're adding what we're adding. **How will this work, is it plausabile to work this way, and is it really necessary to work this way?**

##It's like mobile first, but more granular than that
Starting with an iterative mindset makes the project way more flexible too. Diving into the build and overall structure first doubles down on this, and can help designers have an overall sense of what markup to design for. It also can help with quickly implementing some design elements _(either in the browser or from the designer)_ and allowing the clients to review this in their browser. This is something that is sorely missing from most (that I know) project work, and I would imagine can greatly help the client understand the process and grasp browser incosistencies.

_**However, functional spec is something that might live outside of this, especially for client work.**_ I say this because functional spec on a client project can increase the scope ten-fold in a blink. And I don't mean that it has to be absolutely rigid, of course not; but for the most part the overall objectives and how to make that happen should be fleshed out to a pretty good spot before getting going.
