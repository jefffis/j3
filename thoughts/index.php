				<h1>Simple, Fancy List Item Styling</h1>

				<h1>Tiny SVG as Data URI then upscaled out the wazoo.</h1>
				<p>Save logos and icons as SVGs, but first make them as teeny, tiny as possible. This was created at 4800x zoom. Then convert these bad boys to Data URIs and upscale as needed. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a thought</h2>
				<h1>Content-Aware CSS: WTF?</h1>
				<p>Media Queries are awesome. They really are. Being able to detect a users device width, height, and/or orientation and then being able to style the content they view accordingly is an invaluable tool in any web designers/developers toolkit. They are paramount to the responsive design movement, and makes porting content from device to device without having to create multiple templates somewhat of a synch. And better still, every day, new possibilities/options are being added to them to make them more powerful. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a[n old] thought</h2>
				<h1>Do Google Web Fonts Work [Well] In HTML Email?</h1>
				<p>I&#8217;d seen a few tests on (especially on Campaign Monitor) about CSS (mainly interested in CSS3) and support across email programs. Due to the lack of standards, there isn&#8217;t great support outside of the Apple realm. However, I wanted to test to see how well we could use some of the new Google Web Fonts (as using Typekit is not really an option yet). <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a test/thought</h2>
				<h1>Conditional Resource Loading</h1>
				<p>Something I&rsquo;ve been noodling on for a while now; mobile template or RWD. I was staunchly for mobile templates (for non-personal sites), but I&rsquo;ve begun thinking about how to combine them. In my experience, it&rsquo;s mainly been the homepage that really makes for a slower experience with RWD on a mobile device. There&rsquo;s lots of extra content and resources that are not really needed on mobile that are hidden, but still downloaded. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a thought</h2>
				<h1>CSS Generated Content: What Is It &amp; What&rsquo;s Possible?</h1>
				<p>So what do I mean when I say CSS generated content? Well, it&rsquo;s somewhat complicated, so lemme try to break it down. CSS generated content is a technique that allows content (HTML and/or images) to be inserted into the DOM without actually being included in the HTML. Say what? A bit odd, but basically if you view the source of a page using this, you won&rsquo;t find the corresponding code in the HTML. It&rsquo;s being added in via CSS, and therefore is usually considered just for presentational purposes. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a thought</h2>
				<h1>Faux-Button Frustration</h1>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve recently paid more attention to things that I try to imitate on the web, but use in every day life. The thing that I find the most irksome and concerning is the lack of visual and/or physical interaction with a lot of buttons. The web, especially of late, has done a great job to emphasize the importance of this for user experience, conversion rate, and just general sense of accomplishment. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a thought</h2>
				<h1>SVG + Icon Fonts</h1>
				<p>Retina displays are here. Or for those who don&rsquo;t know what that is, high-resolution screens. And what we&rsquo;ve been typically using as web designers and developers to serve content to normal screens just isn&rsquo;t cutting it anymore. I won&rsquo;t get into serving high-res photos today, as that&rsquo;s been discussed at length by many other smart folk already. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>Southby From A Noobs Eye</h1>
				<p>This past SXSW was my first time attending (many props to @browsermedia &amp; @kerrygunther); and I was super stoked to be able to go</strong> -- a vacation, a chance to learn new kick ass webness, awesome food, awesome music, and awesome people. For the most part, that&#39;s exactly what it was. Austin seems like a great town, filled to the brim with <strong>great taco joints</strong> and <strong>beer dispensaries</strong> (aka bars), so I was glad I finally got to experience that. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>New Face of Web Typography</h1>
				<p>Web fonts: what&#39;s the deal with them, and why should we care about the recent progress?</strong> Simple questions, with lengthy answers. Web fonts are, simply as they sound, typographic faces that have been designed specifically for use on the web, and in many different sizes, resolutions, and monitor types. Sounds pretty complicated right? Well it definitely is. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<p>What&rsquo;s All the Hubbub About Mobile First Mobileness??</strong> While it is a hot new term, It&rsquo;s not just a hot new term. It&rsquo;s much, much more than that. It&rsquo;s a whole new way of thinking about users, content, web design, and the lot. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>What&rsquo;s CTA To You?</h1>
				<p>A Call-to-Action (CTA); a marketers silver bullet. You know what I&rsquo;m referring to: that big, shiny red button that screams &ldquo;Do Whatever I Say, because you know subconsciously you really want to, yet don&rsquo;t know it quite yet.&rdquo; Yeah, that one. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>a thought</h2>
				<h1>Do you justify your web copy?</h1>
				<p>&lsquo;Justified typography creates order and is essentially &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo; typography,&rsquo; a good point made for justification. However, justified text makes for excessive interword spacing, or, spaces that look larger than they should. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>Transitions for the Soul</h1>
				<p>The times they are a-changin&rsquo;. In many more ways than one, but that&rsquo;s definitely the understatement of the year. Web technologies change seemingly every few minutes, users expectations of said technologies change as well, some faster than others though. It&rsquo;s a different world when we go to bed than it was when we awoke. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>The Text, Too</h1>
				<p>For those of us who work on email marketing campaigns at any level, we know that not everyone can/wants to receive the full HTML version of a particular campaign. Some simply cannot receive this, and others simply prefer not to receive this. For these folks, we need to consider the text-only versions of our email campaigns. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>My Problem With Groupon</h1>
				<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of Groupon, or just the concept of daily dealing, then you literally live under a rock. And I do mean literally. The concept is simple: companies agree to sell a product or service at a great price reduction with the hopes of acquiring new customers. There has already been some written about how these deals can turn out veeeerrrrryyyyy poorly for the end businesses. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>

				<h1>Do You Use A CSS Mood Board?</h1>
				<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever worked on a branding project, or a redesign of something, you&rsquo;ve probably been exposed to the concept of a &rsquo;mood board.&rsquo; Basically, it helps designer(s) convey a wide variety of concepts, colors, images, and text all in one spot. This is very helpful for clients in general, but especially those who are more visual learners. <strong>Read More &raquo;</strong></p>
