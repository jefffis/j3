			<h1>Web Samples Are All Too Incestuous</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/V-12-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="V" id="drop-cap" /><del>V</del>isit any major web design/dev site and look for a round-up or review of X, Y, or Z topic. 99/100 sites shown in these &ldquo;posts&rdquo; are always of the same sites.</p>
			<img src="/images/web-samples-wide.jpg" class="move-over more" />
			<p><strong>For the record, I like these sites</strong> -- they are visually well designed, provide great tutorials and content, and do offer good inspiration.</p>
			<h2>But, Why Not Spread Some Web Love?</h2>
			<p>Sure, maybe they all relate to the topic that&rsquo;s being discussed. Or maybe, they are exact examples of the round-up that the article is detailing. Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but I think it&rsquo;s just a bit lame on the part of the article writer to only focus on these sites <em>consistently</em>.</p>
			<p>Using round-ups and reviews is a <strong>great way for lesser known sites/designers/devs to get their name(s) out on the interwebs</strong>. Not in a shameless, self-promotion way, but in a good, organic way:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>make a killer website</li>
				<li>get shown on a post about what makes a killer website</li>
				<li>get some new business/respect</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>So, Here Are Some Other Killer Sites</h2>

			<p>I could list 100s of site (<strong>most that I don&rsquo;t even know exist, but they do</strong>), but the point is there are awesome sites being created daily, search them out &amp; share them.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> there are a good amount of sites that do exploratory showcases; Line25.com and Typekit.com come to mind right now. <em>I&rsquo;m not referring to these sorts of sites however.</em></p>
