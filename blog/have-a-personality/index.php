			<h1>Have A Personality for Pete&#8217;s Sake</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/A-2-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="A" id="drop-cap" /><del>A</del> recent post on Mashable got me thinking about the corporate lifestyle and how different it is from small business. This story was about <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/09/chrysler-drops-the-f-bomb-on-twitter/">how the corporate Chrysler account was hacked and dropped the &#8216;f-bomb&#8217;</a> on the unwitting ears of twitter. Then, Chrysler went into freak mode because [apparently] moms, CEOs, kids, dogs, squirrels, the whole world basically, got offended.</p>
			<h2><strong>Let That Sink In For A Bit</strong></h2>
			<p><strong></strong>The word &#8216;fucking&#8217; got everyone&#8217;s pressed shirts all in a ruffle. For those who didn&#8217;t see the tweet; here it is:</p>
			<p><img title="Chrysler fucks with twitter" src="http://goodwurk.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/chrysler-autos.jpg" alt="Chrysler drops fucking tweet." width="425" height="235" /></p>
			<p>Cute, engaging and relevant; at least I think so. To come from Joe Schmo, then it&#8217;s just random whining, but from Chrysler, then it&#8217;s relatable and humorous.</p>
			<h2><strong>Oh no&#8211;It Said What We All Think</strong></h2>
			<p>The world will collapse &amp; fall because someone might read this. Oh wait, that&#8217;s just silly. I think it&#8217;s actually quite ironic, funny, and spot on. More companies should approach social media like this &#8212; have a personality and take a stand on things. Rather than just churn out corporate-speak-crap, get people engaged in WHO the company is, and WHO makes the company up. No one really cares about what some crap car has done or not, they want to read about something they can relate to.</p>

			<p>As for those who worry about offending other users, it&#8217;s 2011. The internet makes everything available. Literally everything, and there&#8217;s really no hiding or sheltering anything anymore. Granted, I&#8217;m not advocating marketing curse words to kids, but are kids really following Chrysler on twitter? If they are then I only have one thing to say:</p>
			<p><em><strong>WTF is wrong with you, kids?</strong></em><strong><em> </em></strong>Chrysler? At least follow something sexy like Lamborghini or Bughatti.</p>
			<p>Gone are the days when people follow blindly whatever MegaCorp X9 shoves down their throat. So why not humanize yourself, and at least show that people make up these giant conglomerates. Heck, create a social media policy if need be, but don&#8217;t constrain your users to being robotic lamos; that&#8217;s a #fail.</p>

			<p>The original article linked to a story on the Red Cross and <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/16/red-cross-tweet/">how a user announced how she was planning on #gettingslizzerd</a>. This is <strong>NOT</strong> the right way to humanize your brand by any means; I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
