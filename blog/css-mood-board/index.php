			<h1>Do You Create A CSS Mood Board?</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/I-6-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="I" id="drop-cap" /><del>I</del>f you&rsquo;ve ever worked on a branding project, or a redesign of something, you&rsquo;ve probably been exposed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_board" target="_blank">concept of a &rsquo;mood board.</a>&rsquo; Basically, it helps designer(s) convey a wide variety of concepts, colors, images, and text all in one spot. This is very helpful for clients in general, but especially those who are more visual learners.</p>
			<p>I was tinkering on a site the other day, and I was updating some styles that a previous developer (or designer) had forgotten to add <em>(I&rsquo;ve definitely done this myself)</em>. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to predict all the needs and uses of elements on a site, and it&rsquo;s a bit wasteful of time to style every HTML element.</p>
			<h2>Wrong&mdash;You Foolish Fool <em>(Me That Is)</em></h2>
			<p>That was my thought up until this morning, where for some reason I begin thinking about combining mood boards and CSS. My vision is create just a blank page on all sites I work on that contains a lot of lesser known elements with styles applied. Then, the <strong>client can view these and see if there&rsquo;s anything amuck or unappealing</strong>, and while my focus is still on this project, I can update these so, if by chance, they happen to be used in the future, there are no surprises.</p>

			<h2>Some elements I <del>probably</del> should style, but haven&rsquo;t:</h2>
			<pre>
big, small, dd, dl, dt, b, u, i, del,
ins, s, center, sub, sup, abbr,
acronym, address, big, cite</pre>
			<p>A lot of these are deprecated and more progressive web folk might just ignore them, but you never know. You really never know <em>WHO</em> is going to be making changes, and what this person is used to: using &lt;b&gt;, &lt;u&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags for example.</p>
			<p>As I see it, this is kind of an &ldquo;undoing&rdquo; of the CSS reset we all use. Granted, I know I should be doing this on every site, but it just doesn&rsquo;t happen for one reason or another, and I know I&rsquo;m not the only one doing it. So, my goal for the rest of 2011, is to create a <code>/mood-board.html</code> page for every site I work on.</p>
