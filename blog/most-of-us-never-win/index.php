			<h1>[Most of Us] Never Win</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/D-7-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="D" id="drop-cap" /><del>D</del>on&rsquo;t get me wrong, at times being a web designer is very satisfying and I really do love it. But many times I find there is little to no appreciation for the hard work, knowledge and other skills we bring to the table.</p>

			<p>A lot has been said about how clients can be awful and how they can even be from Hell &mdash; I don&rsquo;t feel that way about anyone I&rsquo;ve worked with, thankfully. But, what I&rsquo;ve mostly found is that most of the time, while they do seem to appreciate what I do, it&rsquo;s a very fleeting feeling. When the next deadline hits, all good will has been lost and it&rsquo;s a bit incredulous that what I do takes time, and for the most part, can&rsquo;t be done in less than an hour.</p>
			<h2>Rush Rush Rush</h2>
			<!-- <img src="http://cl.ly/6Fia/photo.PNG" class="full" /> -->
			<p>It&rsquo;s also been said many times that when everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Like the boy who cried wolf, you can&rsquo;t work efficiently when every job or email you get from a client is flagged with two exclamation marks. Obviously I understand that somethings truly are a rush, and obviously I re-prioritize to adjust to this. But the most frustrating thing I encounter is when two or three things are rush rush, and I get them done, and done well mind you, then crickets. For a week. Or maybe for longer. Sure, the client is busy and has a business to run / attend to, but what usually happens after this is the same damn thing. Over and over. Job comes in hot, goes out hot. Fin. Wait. Repeat. It&rsquo;s just very inefficient and, somewhat, disrespectful in my opinion.</p>

			<h2>Not Understanding Isn&rsquo;t An Excuse</h2>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t expect many clients I deal with to understand what I do from day one, if ever. That&rsquo;s not part of the relationship we have. I&rsquo;d like to think they learn something new things every time we interact, and by osmosis, but in the grand scheme, that&rsquo;s why I (and us designers / developers) do what I do. However, having a lack of respect for the job I do is another thing. There are a lot of jobs out there way more difficult, and way more important than what I do. But there are also a lot out there less difficult and less important. But, this doesn&rsquo;t that I should treat anyone I interact with (where money, services, or goods are concerned) should be treated without respect; they&rsquo;re working hard too. So, why is it so bad for designers (more so than developers perhaps) to garner respect from outside their peers? I&rsquo;d figure mainly due to the &lsquo;everyone&rsquo;s a designer&rsquo; mentality.</p>
			<p><strong>Footnote:</strong> this is, I think, way more prevelant in the non-high end design world. By this I mean, design firms who deal with companies who are not used to dealing with design firms. Or, who have had sheltered exposure to them, and thus the same mentality can be prevelant.</p>
