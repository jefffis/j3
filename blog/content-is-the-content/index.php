				<h1>Content IS The Content</h1>
				<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/I-6-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jon Contino" alt="I" id="drop-cap" /><del>I</del> do know that content is king. You know that content is king. <em>Well, maybe you know that.</em> Clients, too, know that content is king. I mean, what client has ever sent any job over with <strong>too few words??</strong> One of mine did just that the other day.</p>
				<p>Surprisingly I was more flummoxed than if they had sent 10 pages of content for a one page website. I even froze for a minute or two. I was actually presented with a semi-blank slate, but was unsure as how best to proceed. Yes, they did send some content&mdash;but it was a few questions, a few buttons and a few banners enigmatically dropped into a PowerPoint.</p>
				<h2>Too Lofty Expectations?</h2>
				<p>Not surprisingly (&amp; understandably), many clients believe what they do / create / sell is Gods gift to the world, and that it shouldn&rsquo;t help selling itself.</p>
