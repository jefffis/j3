			<h1>Sometimes Simpler Just Isn&rsquo;t [Really] Better</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/S-7-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="S" id="drop-cap" /><del>S</del>ure, less is more; I buy that. But simple is not simple to do. Take, for example, this email I received from <a href="http://barackobama.com">barackobama.com</a> today:</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m usually all about simplicity, and especially when it comes to email marketing. But this is just too extreme. On a desktop mail program (I use Apple Mail) that&rsquo;s set to anything wider than 700 or 800px becomes almost unreadable. I have mine set to full screen, about 1600px wide, and it just seemed like a huge waste of content. Lots of studies have proven that <strong>humans just cannot read content that stretches too far across a screen</strong>, just like this email.</p>
			<h2>Granted the iPhone Was Okay As Is</h2>

			<p>But, as <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3442/mobile-email-design-in-practice/">Campaign Monitor showed a few weeks ago</a>, with a little bit of creativity (& some CSS3 tinkering), this could have been a much more effective email overall. Even if the intent was to keep it uber-simple, using media queries, the designer(s) could have at least set this up to be more readable when viewed on a wider screen.</p>

			<h2>Simple Can Be Hard</h2>
			<p>Finding the <strong>right mix between simple</strong> and <strong>simplistically effective</strong> is quite hard to reach at times. Take another look at this, on a mobile device it renders fine & actually entices the user to scroll, but on a desktop, even with all the landscape that is available, I have no idea that there is a video in this email. Sure, the subject line has this, but I&rsquo;d assume there would be some sort of call-to-action for this anywhere near the top of the email.</p>
			<p>Something as simple as hyperlinking the first sentence anchor text might have done it for me. However, something a bit more creative such as showing a button in the top section while the window is larger than a certain width would have been a nice way to handle the different interactions users have with email based on desktop VS mobile viewing.</p>
