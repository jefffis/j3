			<h1>No More Email Excuses</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/I-10-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="I" id="drop-cap" /><del>I</del>t&#8217;s already more than half way through 2011; that should tell you that there&#8217;s no reason to be using pre-2000 methods for email marketing. <strong>None. No excuse whatsoever.</strong> There are plenty of <a title="MailChimp Email Marketing" href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">easy, cheap and effective services</a> to do email marketing right nowadays. <a title="Aussie Email Goodness" href="http://campaignmonitor.com" target="_blank">Plenty of options.</a> Seriously, <a href="http://icontact.com/" target="_blank">plenty of options.</a></p>
			<h2>Ignorance Doesn&#8217;t Cut It Anymore</h2>
			<p>Even a few years ago, I was very against this defense, but the HIPPO always had the last say, so it didn&#8217;t really matter what I thought. Plus, twitter and Facebook were no where near as prevalent in the business world as they are now, so that goes a long way. As email marketers, it&#8217;s unacceptable anymore to do something a) illegal and b) questionable.</p>
			<h2>Illegal, Says Who?</h2>
			<p>The <a title="Don't Spam Me, Bro!" href="http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank">CAN-SPAM Act was written and published in 2003</a>. Albeit not the most interesting piece of legislature, it&#8217;s pretty simple what you as a marketer need to do. You need to ensure that you&#8217;re not spamming people. <em>Plain and simple. </em>If you don&#8217;t have explicit permission, just don&#8217;t hit send.</p>

			<h2>But It&#8217;s Difficult To Do It Right</h2>
			<p>Seriously? That&#8217;s weak at best. Most ESPs today make it so easy, and almost fun, to create a simple opt-in form &amp; install it on your website; they handle all the coding, all you need to do is input the code. Most even offer <a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/chimpadeedoo/" target="_blank">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3029/campaign-monitor-for-your-iphone/P50/" target="_blank">apps</a> (for iOS and Android) that let you collect opt-in emails on the go; most notably at tradeshows! <em>That&#8217;s right, the CEOs wetdream</em> &#8212; no more collecting 2,145 business cards and then having an intern input them in Excel. Plus, it&#8217;s actually a viable method to grow your list. <strong>Again, there&#8217;s just no excuse.</strong></p>
