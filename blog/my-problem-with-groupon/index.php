			<h1>My Problem With Groupon</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/I-11-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="I" id="drop-cap" /><del>I</del>f you haven&rsquo;t heard of Groupon, or just the concept of daily dealing, then you literally live under a rock. And I do <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally" target="_blank">mean literally.</a> The concept is simple: companies agree to sell a product or service at a great price reduction with the hopes of acquiring new customers. There has already been some written about how these deals can turn out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/groupon-single-worst-decision/" target="_blank">veeeerrrrryyyyy poorly for the end businesses</a>, but I&rsquo;d like to diagnose what I think is a poor design choice by Groupon.</p>
			<h2>Let&rsquo;s Check Out Their Email</h2>

			<p>At first glance it&rsquo;s a nice looking email. The subject line and from names are strong&mdash;I&rsquo;d bet that the price in the subject line definitely drives a good amount of opens. This part of the reason why I open them (though the other reason is just b/c I love diagnosing email). Their preheader info, while not optimized for Gmail or iPhone<sup>**</sup>, is still good and helpful to users. <em>Bonus points for the unsubscribe link here though.</em> The overall design is pretty good: the logo is large enough and visible enough, the product shot is nice &amp; engaging (the original looked better). So, from a technical standpoint, it&rsquo;s pretty good. <strong>But there&rsquo;s one HUGE element missing from here.</strong></p>
			<h2>Where Is My Call-to-Action (cta)?</h2>
			<p>Granted this is not the entire email, but I have a pretty generous preview pane on my 24" iMac (I narrowed Mail so I could show the corners &amp; give a frame of reference) and I still cannot see anything except for the dollar amount in the subject line. And even with this, once I&rsquo;ve opened the email, I don&rsquo;t ever look back to the subject line. So, for me, this is a huge miss. For some users, who are accustomed to the daily deal business, this probably doesn&rsquo;t matter that much. But to users who are new, or who just are very busy, the lack of any visible CTA right away is just a bad bad mistake by Groupon<sup>*</sup>.</p>

			<h2>Now What About Livingsocial&rsquo;s Email</h2>

			<p>Ahh, there&rsquo;s my Call-to-Acion! Plus, this also features a simple, visual breakdown of the original price and the deal price to help reduce user friction. The only suggestions I&rsquo;d make here are to optimize this for Gmail and iPhone, and perhaps add a link to mobile version.</p>
			<p><em>* Testing could obviously prove me wrong, but I&rsquo;d be shocked if that were the case.</em> <em>** By <a href="http://www.lyris.com/email-marketing/535-Email-Preheaders-Work-So-Make-Them-Work-For-You" target="_blank">optimize for Gmail and iPhone <em>(scroll down about 2/5 of the way)</em></a> I mean adding hidden wording that these two programs display (automatically if you don&rsquo;t add your own in) in their small preview pane.</em></p>
