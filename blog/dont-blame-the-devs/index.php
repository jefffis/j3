			<h1>Don&rsquo;t [Always] Blame the Devs</h1>
			<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/I-1-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="I" id="drop-cap" /><del>I</del> can&rsquo;t recall the number of times I&rsquo;ve heard people complain about working with web developers and how frustrating of an experience it can be.</p>

			<p>Sure, it <strong>can</strong> be frustrating. Some web designers/developers think too much of themselves, or are just plain hard to deal with.</p>
			<p>But a lot times, there are just a lot of things going on, and more often than not, something that <em>seems</em> easy enough to the client, really isn&rsquo;t that easy. Or if it is easy, it&rsquo;s just time consuming and there might be a good chance for errors without proper testing and spell checking.</p>
			<h2>Everyone Has An Opinion</h2>
			<p>For whatever reason, the web / general-design business doesn&rsquo;t get the respect a lot of other professional services do. Granted, it&rsquo;s human nature to think that they way someone else does something is not the most efficient way (or maybe just my Dad rolled with that attitude). For example, you go to a doctor; he/she says you need surgery, but you really don&rsquo;t think you need it. Chances are, you&rsquo;ll still end up getting the surgery and being better-off in the long run.</p>
			<p>With web work, when a design suggests something (I&rsquo;m taking designers who design with business goals in mind, not just to make things perty), a lot of times a client will come back with their own thoughts/feelings/rants/loves/etc. Sure, they definitely get a say in this, they are paying for it, but it&rsquo;s not too often that they recognize that <strong>we</strong> are the proifessionals, and we want the clients to succeed as much as they themselves do.*</p>

			<h2>As usual, it comes down to education</h2>
			<p>Sometimes a <strong>reasonable</strong> turnaround to a client is a few days. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a few hours. And, in reality, most web designers/devs are juggling multiple clients at multiple stages, and it&rsquo;s tough to get something moved into the slot. Especially when dealing with clients who think that <a href="../most-of-us-never-win/">every job they have is a rush</a>.</p>
			<p>So, while I think it&rsquo;s not always fair to blame the designers/devs, it&rsquo;s also up to us to educate the clients on what we&rsquo;re involved in, and what a reasonable turnaround is.</p>
